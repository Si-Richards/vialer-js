    <h2>Headset</h2>
    <p>
        It is important to use a <em>proper</em> headset, because it will benefit
        you in ergonomics and sound quality. Also you should verify that the correct
        audio device is being used by {{app.name}}.

    <h3>USB</h3>
    <p>
        While we don't have a list of supported headsets, we can generally say
        that a USB headset should work best.
    </p>

    <h3>Bluetooth</h3>
    <p>
        There are more potential issues with a bluetooth headset than with an
        USB headset. We have tested succesfully with the Plantronics BT600
        though. Other headsets should be fine, but we don't give support on
        bluetooth headsets, so please have a USB headset connected in case
        you have issues with {{app.name}} and need support.
    </p>

    <h3>Jack</h3>
    <p>
        Headsets with a jack should be fine, but they don't show up as a
        separate device in the Devices list.
